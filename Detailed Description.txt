Detailed Description -
We often come across scenarios when we have access of things but dont get a proper platform to make it available to the needy.
Therefore we have designed a web application , which acts as a connecting link between the donors and the people in need.

Our application has three areas where you can donate , Food , Medicines and clothes.

It lets the donor register himself and put the description of things which he wants to donate

It consists of a portal which displays the list of availabe things , from which the people in need could select.
Once the person selects the items , it notifies the Donor , along with the person's contact number .
The donor could contact the Person . Thereby fulfilling the purpose.
